# GSoC Playground

This is my personal scratchpad for code snippets, experimental components, and notes during Google Summer of Code 2025 with the Palisadoes Foundation.

It includes early tests, ideas, and quick references for features I'm building â€” such as the topology graph, bandwidth chart, and other UI components.

> This repo is intentionally messy â€” it's a safe space to break things and learn fast.

## ðŸ”§ Structure

- `topology/` â€” Trials for rendering topology graphs (D3, React Flow, layout tests)
- `bandwidth/` â€” Experiments with Recharts for visualizing bandwidth usage
- `components/` â€” Small UI component tests unrelated to charts or topology
- `tables`â€” Table rendering and data manipulation experiments
â€” `frontend` - UI scaffolding, and experiments
- `notes/` â€” Setup instructions, useful commands, links, GSoC planning

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This repo:
- Reflects real development in progress
- Helps keep track of rough work that doesn't belong in PRs (yet)
- Serves as a backup for experimental or one-off components
